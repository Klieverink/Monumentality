      <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
      <p class="w3-opacity" id="Bitsofhistory" style="padding-bottom: 40px;"><i>Bits of history</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">“Klieverink” is one of the 4 towers in Bijlmer that are part of the original plan for the
        district. The construction has been completed in 1970. The building is situated in a neighborhood called K-buurt
        and together with a shopping center and metro station the area is better known as “Kraaiennest”. In 2007 the
        towers Kralenbeek, Kempering, Klieverink, Kouwenoord were renovated to fit the new vision for the K-Buurt. Main
        changes included renovation of the facade finishing by covering it with aluminum plates. Additionally, the
        entrances of each building were made bigger and brighter in color to appear more inviting from urban spaces.

      </p>

      <p class="w3-opacity" id="Klieverinkandmonumentality" style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Klieverink and
          monumentality</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">There has been a discussion around the extent to which the preserved buildings in the
        neighborhood should be protected. When talking about the towers it is difficult to imagine that one of them
        could be gone due to some new development plans. And although no such plans are there in place, the recognition
        of the building as a ‘monument’ could secure its presence for the future. The idea of Klieverink being granted
        such status of a monument is a good example of problematic aspects of positioning the Modernistic heritage in
        very classically understood frames and set of rules of monumentality. The essay analyzing the case was written
        and a lot of arguments and ways of thought were presented, however, as rich as the literature review and
        research was, we realized that the analysis missed an ‘inhabitants factor’. When analyzing the buildings such as
        Klieverink and their surroundings it is crucial to underline the value of community and people's opinions on
        that matter. The truth is that the conversation about Klieverink being a monument came from a kind of bottom-up
        approach where people want to protect the history and significant heritage of the district. It seemed crucial to
        ask people themselves how does it feel to live in the district and in the building in particular and what they
        think about it in terms of social problems, values, architecture, location, history. We needed to compare our
        findings with what people think, as well as visit the location and grasp a feeling of the neighborhood.

      </p>


      <p class="w3-opacity" id='Literature' style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Community Centre</i></p>
      <p class="w3-opacity" style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Literature and history vs personal experience and
          reality</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">The literature and historical research was crucial at the beginning but it was important
        that as a group we try to understand the reality more personally. On one of the cloudy afternoon we traveled to
        Bijlmer. The district was indeed far from the center of Amsterdam and at first, it seemed a bit desolated,
        however when passing high buildings, or the stadium one could still feel that the city was not yet left behind.
        <br>
        <br>
        When walking around the district we realized that indeed the buildings are rather far apart from one another and
        the in-between spaces leave out green but it is not always taken care of. This all creates the feeling that the
        human scale is missing somewhere. Moreover, being there for the first time it is quite surprising that at times
        it is difficult to find the way with the bike and not end up at some rather busier car road, which normally is
        not confusing in other districts. However, this is probably the issue only when one arrives there for the first
        time.
        <br>
        <br>
        The feeling of the space created by honeycomb high structures with green areas in between appeared to be way
        different than expected and not comparable with any other place in Amsterdam. Meandering under the tall
        structure into the open space and then again under the building and again out, suddenly realizing that there is
        a giant train viaduct going just in front is quite different to what one could be used to in the Netherlands.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the day the district seems green, calm, and interesting rather than like a dangerous neighborhood, as it
        is usually described. However, the fact that most of the housing starts from the first floor and that there are
        rather dark passes in between the buildings might give an impression that in the evening you might not feel so
        safe.
        <br>
        <br>
        It could be seen that there is a lot of ethnic diversity in the district, however, the cultural backgrounds are
        those of rather not white origins. What’s more, the bad reputation of the neighborhood might enhance the
        prejudice of people entering the district for the first time. They might expect certain conditions or be too
        much opinionated and reserved. For example, it used to be said that the district used to be like a ghetto.
        Although it is not said to be like that any more many people might still be automatically judgmental when coming
        and seeing people from certain origins just because so many things we're told in the past and are kind or
        inherited in the narrative of the district. Hopefully, this will continue to change with upcoming years and it
        will be more underlined that Bijlmer is improving rather than that it used to be bad.

        <p class="w3-opacity" id='CommunityCentre' style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Community Centre</i></p>

        <p class="w3-justify">After walking around the district we headed to the community center that is right next to
          the analyzed building. When entering it was quite surprising that actually few things were happening there at
          the same time. A few elderly men were chatting at the table and having a coffee. There were sewing workshops
          in one room and almost all of the machines were taken. And then there was always somebody going in and out. We
          started the conversation with a person at the desk and got the idea that the community center here is a lively
          spot, with a lot of happenings, gathering people that want to do something together or improve certain things.
          It was mentioned that the week before there was a BBQ for people from Klieverink building and that many people
          came to have a chat.

        <!-- INT 1-->

        <p class="w3-opacity" id='interview-1' , style="padding-bottom: 40px; padding-top: 40px;"><i>Interview 1</i></p>

        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Do you have the feeling that the Kraaiennest has changed in recent years?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Well, there will be a very large park above the a9 anyway. The tunnel has already been completed and the cars can already pass through it. In addition, a lot of new residential areas are being built in south-east Amsterdam. Behind this community center they have turned the old flat into handy apartments. So you see, things do not change  just a little but very drastically. Despite the violence, it is a child-friendly and pleasant neighborhood. I guess every neighborhood has its flaws. For example, many people come to this community center for activities. Here they take Dutch classes, yoga, knitting and sewing, among other things. There are also many local residents who organize activities here themselves, such as the heart for the K-buurt. It's a really nice neighborhood. With the Arena Boulevard it is almost a city within a city.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Will urban renewal not come at the expense of the people who live here now?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Of course. We recently had a meeting here with local residents who complain that houses are no longer affordable. They then have to leave for Zaandam and Assendelft because the houses are cheaper there. The yuppies will come this way. But fortunately there are also plenty of people who have bought a house here in the past.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Are there more community centers such as the Bonte Kraai in this area?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">De Bonte Kraai is the only community center in this district, but our organization has five community centers spread across the Bijlmer. We got one for each neighborhood. </p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Could you tell us a little more about what Hart voor de K-buurt does exactly?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Hart voor de K-buurt is a neighborhood organization here in Kraaiennest that stands up for the interests of local residents. Mike, coordinator of Hart voor de K-buurt can tell you a lot more about this. For example, they are in contact with the municipality about what is going to happen in the neighbourhood; whether they have plans or not. Mike is much more involved than we are actually. As an employee of this community center I do, of course, talk to a lot of people, but I don't know exactly what is going on in terms of content.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Are many people closely involved in the neighbourhood? How do local residents feel about any changes?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">I wouldn't say that people are very attached to the buildings around here. People are attached to their own homes. They like it here. Many people will therefore have a negative attitude towards the demolition of the buildings because consequently people will need to  leave to live elsewhere. They won't come back. So I think they're mostly afraid to change, because as a result they might lose their own space. Some people were also born here in the south-east and they just don't want to leave. I understand that very well.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>If the community could change anything, what would it be?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">I don't think the community would want to change much apart from the violence. A lot has changed and things are going really well.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>How did you come to work here?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">A cousin of mine worked here and I actually worked in a company. I worked for the technical department for fifteen years, but unfortunately the company went bankrupt and I had to look for a new job. That's how I came to work here. It's a whole different world here and you really are among the people. I really like that. I've been working here for six years now and I'm still enjoying myself. We can't all be directors. People have a good relationship with me. I am a familiar face. Not everyone is free to talk to someone else, but when I'm here we can always have a conversation.</p>

           <!-- INT 2-->

           <p class="w3-opacity" id='interview-2' , style="padding-bottom: 40px; padding-top: 40px;"><i>Interview 2</i></p>
           <p class="w3-justify"><b>What do you think of the Klieverink building?</b></p>
           <p class="w3-justify">It’s a great flat and I love my apartment! It is always clean and there is a mutual understanding. The neighbors always greet each other kindly. People all know each other because most people have been living there for a long time. In the long run it becomes a family and we also take care of each other. I know nearly three quarters of the people who live there.</p> 
           <p class="w3-justify"><b>Do you happen to know if there are any renovations on the agenda in the near future?</b></p>
           <p class="w3-justify">We regularly have work when needed but I don't think there are any major renovations on the agenda right now.</p> 
           <p class="w3-justify"><b>Do you feel at home in the neighbourhood?</b></p>
           <p class="w3-justify">It's a good neighborhood. There is occasional violence, but I guess street violence is a broader societal issue right? Even in neat places such as Bloemendaal and Apeldoorn they had problems regarding violence. Fact is though,  there are  many nationalities here. Let alone in Kraaiennest; if you ask random strangers where they come from, you’ll find there are people from all over the world. Not everyone knows exactly where the other comes from. I once told someone that I’m from Suriname and this man thought Suriname was some country in Africa. But despite the fact that everyone has a different background, we get along well. For example, two weeks ago we had a barbecue at the Klieverink flat. There were Poles, Moroccans and Surinamese, but everyone takes care of one another. I had bought  meat at the mall so the Moroccans know that it has been ritually slaughtered. This way everyone can have a bite. I don't find it hard at all to adapt to the cultural differences. If my Polish neighbors want to party, I let them party. We even have our own group chat from the Klieverink flat in which we  keep each other informed if, for example, an unknown person is in the hallway.</p> 
           <p class="w3-justify"><b>For what reason did you come to the community center this afternoon? Will you be participating in one of the activities?</b></p>
           <p class="w3-justify">We have the Crow's Bundle, which is a men's group that we meet on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. We make it fun! Now I just popped in to see how everyone is.</p> 
           <p class="w3-justify"><b>What do you think of the changes in the neighbourhood?</b></p>
           <p class="w3-justify">All kinds of people are now moving here from far outside Amsterdam. The houses behind this community center were handy houses and naturally attracted many yuppies. These yuppies also organize barbecues  and we even receive their  invitation via Hart voor de  K-buurt. In addition, they sometimes come to eat in the Bonte Kraai.</p> 
          
      </div>

      <p class="w3-justify">In another part of the building, there was some social help happening with people coming
        chatting and picking up things. There we found our second interviewee.

          <!-- INT 3-->

          <p class="w3-opacity" id='interview-3' , style="padding-bottom: 40px; padding-top: 40px;"><i>Interview 3</i></p>
          <p class="w3-justify"><b>Do you happen to live in the Klieverink building?</b></p>
          <p class="w3-justify">No, the Klieverink building is full of social housing.Half the inhabitants never get out. Look at all the bikes that are stalled on the balconies.  All sorts of people are living there. In that other Kempering flat many elderly people live. They even had their own dining room and supermarket over there. These elderly people organized the shop themselves, but unfortunately they’d to close it and  now they’ve to go to the local supermarket for their groceries;  all because of this studpid prick Mark Rutte, our prime minister, who cut down most of the subsidies for local neighborhood initiatives. That's why I'm volunteering at the food bank as of now.</p>
          <p class="w3-justify"><b>What’s your opinion on the current mayor of Amsterdam?</b></p>
          <p class="w3-justify">Oh she can fuck off as well!You see, I’ve been a youth worker in Bijlmer for ten years; I used to work in Gein at the time. While doing this work you start noticing a lot of money from the municipality ends up in the wrong places. For example; a lot of single mothers come here to the food bank. They don't have any money, but every year they give birth to a new baby. They bear children in order to receive child allowance. Often the father is not entirely out of touch, because those girls regularly just have a lath relationship. However, if the father is registered, he must also pay child alimentation which would be at the expense of child allowance. </p>
         
          <p class="w3-justify">Halsema  sends all kinds of authorities into the neighborhood to provide information on the topic, but these authorities better act up and do  something about these constructions. There are far too many authorities in the Netherlands that have no idea what is really going on. They can write policies whatever they want, but they will also have to act on it at some point.</p>
          
          <p class="w3-justify">In addition, you should eradicate subletting in the Bijlmer. If you did, half of the Bijlmer would be empty. Just look at the supermarkets around here. There are signs all over the place with rooms for rent. Some immigrants are allowed to participate in family reunification and have been allocated a family home here. Subsequently, these immigrants send their family back home and sublet their apartments to third parties . After all, he suddenly has three rooms available for renting. Do the math: three times five hundred per month plus all kinds of allowances. With this money they can support their families back home and even  guarantee them a royal lifestyle. I really don't want to be racist, but those kinds of constructions should not be allowed…</p>

          <p class="w3-justify"><b>Do you think architecture can positively change the neighborhood?</b></p>
          <p class="w3-justify">Listen, they've destroyed enough here already, haven't they. There used to be a lot of homeless people in the parking garage who missbehaved themselves and thereafter bothered the inhabitants . They decided to demolish the garage completely, but that did not solve the problem. The homeless just relocated to various other locations in this neighbourhood. </p>
          <p class="w3-justify">Honestly I don’t see any further renovations take place either. This neighbourhood is older than, for example, Rijgersbos. It’s architecture is not sustainable. In the near future all of these buildings will need to meet the sustainability requirements. Taking in consideration almost all of those buildings are ascertained to be label E, refurbishing these buildings to current standards will be a hell of a job. Besides, it would cost too much money. I guess, for now the facades of the buildings look fine to me. I do find it annoying though most of the balconies are stashed with trash and bikes that will never get off. The same goes for the streets. It is full of bicycles here, but out of 20 bicycles, 15 have a flat tire. They just neglect to repair the bikes and so these same old bikes pollute the public space for over 10 years.</p>         
            
          <p class="w3-justify"><b>Do you happen to know when the last major refurbishment was?</b></p>
          <p class="w3-justify">Listen, these flats were built simultaneously with the rest of the Bijlmer. It was said to be a new residential area for the citizens of Amsterdam, but they were talking bullshit. As Indonesia was on the break of independence in 1956 the municipality decided in a hurry to build Slotermeer. As for the Bijlmer,  they knew that Suriname wanted to become independent and thereafter an estimated 300.000 immigrants would come this way. Spreading them across the country never occurred as a feasible solution, because you can’t ask these people to give up on their family, friends and community. So the majority of the immigrants ended up living in the Bijlmer. Therefore one could, with all due respect, designate the Bijlmer as ‘ little Suriname’.</p>

          <p class="w3-justify"><b>DWhat are your thoughts on the new developments in this area? </b></p>
          <p class="w3-justify">As you’ve probably heard right now, they tunneled a huge part of the highway and constructed a park on top of it. The houses standing close to the exhaust of the highway are now overloaded with the fumes. But that put aside, a tunnel should never have  been a top priority here. In the past I asked the municipality to refund  a weekend trip for some kids from the neighbourhood. I didn't get the money as the municipality prioritized other things. These kids were in deep shit because of all kinds of domestic problems, but apparently the municipality thinks only white kids got these kinds of problems. You see what I’m trying to tell you? Money is spent on the wrong things. You have to invest in the community, before investing in beautifying the neighborhood.  </p>

      <!-- text-->
      <p class="w3-justify">We decided to go near the building and get in, to see how it feels and possibly find some
        people that could talk to us at the first glance the building has quite a spacious entrance and after the
        renovation, it became much more transparent. What was peculiar from the very beginning was the numbering on the
        post boxes, and then as we saw it, at every door. We were advised by some of the people we talked to in the
        building, to go the whole way up and appreciate the view. Indeed it was quite amazing and as the building is
        really tall it is quite special for Amsterdam to see this much green landscape. The issue that we discovered
        when
        appreciating the view, was that apparently there is still a problem with people sleeping at the staircases near
        to
        the common balconies. There are also problems with people defecating those places, which is pretty horrible. We understood that not only because of the smell but also because of the angry notes that were left on the doors.
        Besides this problem, the building is not cluttered and is kept clean. On the clean ground floor in the glass
        cabinet, there was not much information left for people. However, it was a bit alarming to see a portrait of a
        police officer. This officer was said to be in charge of incidents happening in the surrounding.

        While walking in, up and down the building we had an opportunity to have some quick chats with people we passed
        by. They were very open and friendly. Also, the diversity of people here seems to be even broader, with diverse
        origins, Dutch, Surinamese, African, Indonesian, Indian, and also some European countries as we heard. In
        general,
        it seems that indeed there is a kind of closer relationship between the neighbors. In the elevator, the woman
        with
        two children was chatting with an elderly man when we were going up, and then again while taking the elevator
        down
        there was a middle-aged woman and a young guy and they were quite chatty while helping us to pick the correct
        floor to get down, as apparently after the renovation it is not that obvious. / Anecdote about the levels/ Even
        in
        such a short experience we could observe that people know one another and have a friendly relationship.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some people we interviewed for longer told us a bit more about the situation in the building.

      <p class="w3-justify"><b>How do you like your home?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Very good. It is clean and you have a nice view. We have no problems. We live in a three-room apartment, but there are also smaller houses. I live down here so I even have a terrace. We have a lot of outdoor space and we really like it. It is true that we actually do not have room for our bicycle, thats missing, but people take them with them into their homes.</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity" id='interview-5' , style="padding-bottom: 40px; padding-top: 40px;"><i>Interview 5</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify"><b>How do you like your home?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Well, the people here are very friendly. Many people of different nationalities live here, but everyone respects each other. Events such as the barbecue are also regularly organized among the apartment residents. Not everyone is always partly because of the corona of course, but it's just fun; not super spectacular, but just nice. It is only when you really live here that you notice that people are very friendly to each other.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"><b>As a resident, would you be in favor of protecting the Klieverink building as a monument? This would also mean making changes to the building more difficult.</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">There is now mainly lower construction here. They want to get rid of some other flats. I'm certainly in favor of that, but that's also because I haven't lived here all my life. For many older people, the changes are big. They obviously have more trouble with it than I do. In any case, I think that the new generation has no problem with the innovations. Although I have to say that if you demolish the flats here, you have to realize that you also have to take care of replacement. It has been almost impossible to find a home in Amsterdam lately. The prices are unbelievably high and would drive the people who now live here from the city. I find it hard to say whether the changes are making the neighborhood better or worse. That, as far as I'm concerned, remains to be seen.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"><b>Would you be in favor of a renovation?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Not necessarily; it depends on whether the renovation improves the living environment of the current residents. If the renovation means that the apartments will become more expensive, I am not necessarily for it. Many people live here through social housing or with a lower income and renovation should never be at the expense of them.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify"><b>Suppose only the architecture were to change and nothing else, would this be positive for the neighbourhood?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Of course, If people themselves are part of the change, they are not against it. The renewal of the neighborhood that is currently taking place feels like a threat to some people here. All kinds of new people are moving in from outside the neighborhood and it feels like they are driving out the current residents. Especially for the people who have lived here for a long time, it is a terrifying picture if they have to move from the neighborhood where they know everyone. If the transformation of the neighborhood is at the expense of the current residents, this also guarantees that friction will arise. This will only complicate integration and reinforce segregation.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify" style="padding-bottom: 40px; ;">At the end of our trip we had two interesting people that added a bit of wandering to both how the district is and also to the purpose of our work. </p>

      <p class="w3-justify">At first, we were standing apart   doing some sketches of the location, when a middle-aged
        lady approached and asked politely what are we doing because she saw us documenting something. We started
        explaining why are we here and what are we doing and a conversation started. She was willing to tell us a bit
        about how she feels living here, however when asked whether we could record what she says, she refused as she
        was not trusting. This was understandable and it teaches us that for the next time it is maybe a bit more
        important to some people to introduce ourselves more reliably. The fault was on our side. Anyhow the lady talked
        to us and although she said she likes to live here, it is not as calm as it seems. She mentioned that there is
        still a lot of crime and undisciplined young people that should be busy with other things than for example drugs
        or misbehaving in general. She said that she always has a bit of worry and anxiety in her heart, that something
        might happen one day to her child when he’s playing outside. It seems from what she said that there is still a
        lot to be done. We asked her

        <p class="w3-justify"><b>If you had a chance would you decide to move to another district?</b></p>

        (rephrasing)”Noo… Bijlmer, West or another district, it is all Amsterdam, I feel good here, every district has
        its problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        It seemed that although there are still issues there is still much value in staying here and a lot of
        attachment.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second very important, yet short conversation that made us feel wandering about the actual purpose of us
        writing an essay and going and asking people questions happened near the community center. When walking to the
        buildings we saw a group of young girls listening to music and dancing. We decided to ask them a few questions,
        but we received quite a hostile answer. This answer was however very true to how they felt and made us ask
        ourselves even more questions.

      <p class="w3-justify" style="padding-bottom: 40px; ; ">  

        After we introduced ourselves and asked about the neighborhood and the building, we heard that they
        don’t want to talk to us about it, as many people like us, students, come and make research in the area, but
        nothing changes after that. We were sort of treated like outsiders, intruders that just seem to understand the
        surface, and have not lived here, are not of similar origins and do not really make effort to understand, and
        also have no power to change anything.
        <br>
        <br>
        We could understand this frustration. The frustration of young people being annoyed that although so much
        research, nothing is changing. They lost belief in ‘talking to people that are not in a position to make
        changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is true, and sadly we probably can not do much besides academic research, however, our take on the topic was
        that at least we could add up to the literature, experiences, and thoughts on the topic, as well as bring
        something to the table that maybe could be also used by future students. Moreover, from a personal perspective,
        it was an interesting journey to research and try to understand such important locations, see what makes certain
        communities come together, think about difficult architecture and urbanism, and aim to answer some questions
        about Modernism and monumentality. However, what was even more interesting was that we pushed ourselves to try
        to talk to people that normally we would probably never meet. Listen to them, speak passionately about the
        district, and feel welcomed. This will make us new people having a positive experience with the district and
        ones that can share that experience further, also by writing this short article.
