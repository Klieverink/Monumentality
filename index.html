      <p class="w3-opacity" id="Bitsofhistory" style="padding-bottom: 40px;"><i>Bits of history</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">“Klieverink” is one of the 4 towers in Bijlmer that are part of the original plan for the
        district. The construction has been completed in 1970. The building is situated in a neighborhood called K-buurt
        and together with a shopping center and metro station the area is better known as “Kraaiennest”. In 2007 the
        towers Kralenbeek, Kempering, Klieverink, Kouwenoord were renovated to fit the new vision for the K-Buurt. Main
        changes included renovation of the facade finishing by covering it with aluminum plates. Additionally, the
        entrances of each building were made bigger and brighter in color to appear more inviting from urban spaces.

      </p>

      <p class="w3-opacity" id="Klieverinkandmonumentality" style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Klieverink and
          monumentality</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">There has been a discussion around the extent to which the preserved buildings in the
        neighborhood should be protected. When talking about the towers it is difficult to imagine that one of them
        could be gone due to some new development plans. And although no such plans are there in place, the recognition
        of the building as a ‘monument’ could secure its presence for the future. The idea of Klieverink being granted
        such status of a monument is a good example of problematic aspects of positioning the Modernistic heritage in
        very classically understood frames and set of rules of monumentality. The essay analyzing the case was written
        and a lot of arguments and ways of thought were presented, however, as rich as the literature review and
        research was, we realized that the analysis missed an ‘inhabitants factor’. When analyzing the buildings such as
        Klieverink and their surroundings it is crucial to underline the value of community and people's opinions on
        that matter. The truth is that the conversation about Klieverink being a monument came from a kind of bottom-up
        approach where people want to protect the history and significant heritage of the district. It seemed crucial to
        ask people themselves how does it feel to live in the district and in the building in particular and what they
        think about it in terms of social problems, values, architecture, location, history. We needed to compare our
        findings with what people think, as well as visit the location and grasp a feeling of the neighborhood.

      </p>


      <p class="w3-opacity" id='Literature' style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Community Centre</i></p>
      <p class="w3-opacity" style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Literature and history vs personal experience and
          reality</i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">The literature and historical research was crucial at the beginning but it was important
        that as a group we try to understand the reality more personally. On one of the cloudy afternoon we traveled to
        Bijlmer. The district was indeed far from the center of Amsterdam and at first, it seemed a bit desolated,
        however when passing high buildings, or the stadium one could still feel that the city was not yet left behind.
        <br>
        <br>
        When walking around the district we realized that indeed the buildings are rather far apart from one another and
        the in-between spaces leave out green but it is not always taken care of. This all creates the feeling that the
        human scale is missing somewhere. Moreover, being there for the first time it is quite surprising that at times
        it is difficult to find the way with the bike and not end up at some rather busier car road, which normally is
        not confusing in other districts. However, this is probably the issue only when one arrives there for the first
        time.
        <br>
        <br>
        The feeling of the space created by honeycomb high structures with green areas in between appeared to be way
        different than expected and not comparable with any other place in Amsterdam. Meandering under the tall
        structure into the open space and then again under the building and again out, suddenly realizing that there is
        a giant train viaduct going just in front is quite different to what one could be used to in the Netherlands.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the day the district seems green, calm, and interesting rather than like a dangerous neighborhood, as it
        is usually described. However, the fact that most of the housing starts from the first floor and that there are
        rather dark passes in between the buildings might give an impression that in the evening you might not feel so
        safe.
        <br>
        <br>
        It could be seen that there is a lot of ethnic diversity in the district, however, the cultural backgrounds are
        those of rather not white origins. What’s more, the bad reputation of the neighborhood might enhance the
        prejudice of people entering the district for the first time. They might expect certain conditions or be too
        much opinionated and reserved. For example, it used to be said that the district used to be like a ghetto.
        Although it is not said to be like that any more many people might still be automatically judgmental when coming
        and seeing people from certain origins just because so many things we're told in the past and are kind or
        inherited in the narrative of the district. Hopefully, this will continue to change with upcoming years and it
        will be more underlined that Bijlmer is improving rather than that it used to be bad.

        <p class="w3-opacity" id='CommunityCentre' style="padding-bottom: 60px40px;"><i>Community Centre</i></p>

        <p class="w3-justify">After walking around the district we headed to the community center that is right next to
          the analyzed building. When entering it was quite surprising that actually few things were happening there at
          the same time. A few elderly men were chatting at the table and having a coffee. There were sewing workshops
          in one room and almost all of the machines were taken. And then there was always somebody going in and out. We
          started the conversation with a person at the desk and got the idea that the community center here is a lively
          spot, with a lot of happenings, gathering people that want to do something together or improve certain things.
          It was mentioned that the week before there was a BBQ for people from Klieverink building and that many people
          came to have a chat.

        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Heeft u het idee dat het Kraaiennest de afgelopen jaren verandert?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Er komt sowieso een heel groot park boven de a9. Die tunnel daar is al af en de auto’s
          kunnen er al door heen. Er worden daarnaast heel veel nieuwbouwwijken gebouwd in zuid-oost. Hierachter hebben
          ze van deze flat klusappartementen gemaakt. Het verandert niet een beetje maar heel drastisch. Ondanks dat er
          wel geweld is, is het wel een kindvriendelijke en gezellige buurt. Elk huisje heeft zijn kruisje. In dit
          buurthuis komen bijvoorbeeld ook heel veel mensen activiteiten ondernemen. Ze doen hier onder andere aan
          Nederlandse lessen, yoga, breien en naaien. Er zijn daarnaast ook veel buurbewoners die hier zelf activiteiten
          organiseren zoals hart voor de K-buurt. Het is echt een hartstikke leuke buurt hier. Ook met de Arenaboulevard
          is het bijna een stad in een stad.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"><b>Gaat de stadsvernieuwing niet ten kosten van de mensen die hier nu wonen?</b></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Uiteraard. We hebben hier onlangs ook een vergadering gehad met buurtbewoners die klagen
          dat de huizen niet meer betaalbaar zijn. Die moeten dan vertrekken naar Zaandam en Assendelft want daar zijn
          de woningen goedkoper. De juppen komen dan deze kant op. Maar er zijn ook genoeg mensen die hier een huis
          hebben gekocht hoor.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify">In another part of the building, there was some social help happening with people coming
        chatting and picking up things. There we found our second interviewee.

      <!-- INT 2-->


      <p class="w3-justify"><b>Wat vindt u van het Klieverink gebouw?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Het is een top van een flat! Het is er altijd schoon en er is begrip voor elkaar. De buren
        begroeten elkaar altijd vriendelijk. Mensen kennen elkaar allemaal omdat de meeste mensen daar al heel lang
        wonen. Op den duur wordt het dus een familie en we zorgen ook voor elkaar. Ik ken bijna driekwart van de mensen
        die daar woont. </p>


      <p class="w3-justify"><b>Weet u toevallig of er binnenkort nog renovaties op de agenda staan?</b></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">We hebben regelmatig werkzaamheden wanneer die nodig staan maar volgens mij staan er nu geen
        grote renovaties op de agenda.</p>


      <img src="tower view.jpg" alt="">
      <p style="text-align: center; color: darkgray;">Photo of the district or community center.</p>



      <!-- INT 3-->
      <p class="w3-justify">We decided to go near the building and get in, to see how it feels and possibly find some
        people that could talk to us at the first glance the building has quite a spacious entrance and after the
        renovation, it became much more transparent. What was peculiar from the very beginning was the numbering on the
        post boxes, and then as we saw it, at every door. We were advised by some of the people we talked to in the
        building, to go the whole way up and appreciate the view. Indeed it was quite amazing and as the building is
        really tall it is quite special for Amsterdam to see this much green landscape. The issue that we discovered
        when
        appreciating the view, was that apparently there is still a problem with people sleeping at the staircases near
        to
        the common balconies. There are also problems with people defecating those places, which is pretty horrible. We
        understood that not only because of the smell but also because of the angry notes that were left on the doors.
        Besides this problem, the building is not cluttered and is kept clean. On the clean ground floor in the glass
        cabinet, there was not much information left for people. However, it was a bit alarming to see a portrait of a
        police officer. This officer was said to be in charge of incidents happening in the surrounding.
        <br>
        <br>
        While walking in, up and down the building we had an opportunity to have some quick chats with people we passed
        by. They were very open and friendly. Also, the diversity of people here seems to be even broader, with diverse
        origins, Dutch, Surinamese, African, Indonesian, Indian, and also some European countries as we heard. In
        general,
        it seems that indeed there is a kind of closer relationship between the neighbors. In the elevator, the woman
        with
        two children was chatting with an elderly man when we were going up, and then again while taking the elevator
        down
        there was a middle-aged woman and a young guy and they were quite chatty while helping us to pick the correct
        floor to get down, as apparently after the renovation it is not that obvious. / Anecdote about the levels/ Even
        in
        such a short experience we could observe that people know one another and have a friendly relationship.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some people we interviewed for longer told us a bit more about the situation in the building.
      </p>


      <img src="Entrance.jpg" alt="">
      <p style="text-align: center; color: darkgray;">Entrance to the building.</p>


      <p class="w3-opacity" style="padding-bottom: 40px; ;"><i>At the end of our trip we had two interesting people that
          added a bit of wandering to both how the district is and also to the purpose of our work. </i></p>

      <p class="w3-justify">At first, we were standing apart doing some sketches of the location, when a middle-aged
        lady approached and asked politely what are we doing because she saw us documenting something. We started
        explaining why are we here and what are we doing and a conversation started. She was willing to tell us a bit
        about how she feels living here, however when asked whether we could record what she says, she refused as she
        was not trusting. This was understandable and it teaches us that for the next time it is maybe a bit more
        important to some people to introduce ourselves more reliably. The fault was on our side. Anyhow the lady talked
        to us and although she said she likes to live here, it is not as calm as it seems. She mentioned that there is
        still a lot of crime and undisciplined young people that should be busy with other things than for example drugs
        or misbehaving in general. She said that she always has a bit of worry and anxiety in her heart, that something
        might happen one day to her child when he’s playing outside. It seems from what she said that there is still a
        lot to be done. We asked her
        <br>
        <br>

        : If she had a chance would you decide to move to another district?
        <br>
        <br>
        (rephrasing)”Noo… Bijlmer, West or another district, it is all Amsterdam, I feel good here, every district has
        its problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        It seemed that although there are still issues there is still much value in staying here and a lot of
        attachment.
        <br>
        <br>
        The second very important, yet short conversation that made us feel wandering about the actual purpose of us
        writing an essay and going and asking people questions happened near the community center. When walking to the
        buildings we saw a group of young girls listening to music and dancing. We decided to ask them a few questions,
        but we received quite a hostile answer. This answer was however very true to how they felt and made us ask
        ourselves even more questions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Interview…: After we introduced ourselves and asked about the neighborhood and the building, we heard that they
        don’t want to talk to us about it, as many people like us, students, come and make research in the area, but
        nothing changes after that. We were sort of treated like outsiders, intruders that just seem to understand the
        surface, and have not lived here, are not of similar origins and do not really make effort to understand, and
        also have no power to change anything.
        <br>
        <br>
        We could understand this frustration. The frustration of young people being annoyed that although so much
        research, nothing is changing. They lost belief in ‘talking to people that are not in a position to make
        changes.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is true, and sadly we probably can not do much besides academic research, however, our take on the topic was
        that at least we could add up to the literature, experiences, and thoughts on the topic, as well as bring
        something to the table that maybe could be also used by future students. Moreover, from a personal perspective,
        it was an interesting journey to research and try to understand such important locations, see what makes certain
        communities come together, think about difficult architecture and urbanism, and aim to answer some questions
        about Modernism and monumentality. However, what was even more interesting was that we pushed ourselves to try
        to talk to people that normally we would probably never meet. Listen to them, speak passionately about the
        district, and feel welcomed. This will make us new people having a positive experience with the district and
        ones that can share that experience further, also by writing this short article.
